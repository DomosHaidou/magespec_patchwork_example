magespec_patchwork_example
==========================

Example implementation and use of patchwork with magespec.

What is this?
=============

This is a quickly hacked together proof of concept to see if there is a way to work around Magento God class when
writing tests. This is achieved by using the [Patchwork Library]('https://github.com/antecedent/patchwork')

> A pure PHP library that lets you redefine user-defined functions at runtime. In other words, Patchwork is a
> partial implementation of runkit_function_redefine in userland PHP 5.3 code.

This is by no means a final or even sane implementation; but rather an base idea to start working.
